full description of the Decoding_snmp_mib 
acquire applied practical knowledge about the SNMP message encoding.
In this code,we will develop a Python utility program that decodes a SNMP
message and displays the information it contains in a well-formatted, readable fashion. This
we need to first master the Basic Encoding Rules (BER)
and how different SMI data types are encoded inside SNMP messages that we covered in
class.
The script requirements are as follows:
1. The script accepts a single command line argument: a name of text file that contains
the Hex dump of the bytes of one SNMP message, e.g., msg.txt. For example,
the script will be run as follows
python3 xxxxxx.py msg.txt
where xxxxxx is file name
The format of the file contents is as follows
30 3c 02 01 01 04 06 70 75 62 6c 69 63 a0 2f 02
04 38 98 7d cf 02 01 00 02 01 00 30 21 30 0e 06
0a 2b 06 01 02 01 02 02 01 06 03 05 00 30 0f 06
0b 2b 06 01 02 01 1f 01 01 01 06 01 05 00
2. The script will be executed on a Linux machine.
3. The script displays on the standard output the following information for the SNMP
message: the size of the SNMP message in bytes, the SNMP version, the community
string, the PDU type, the request ID, the error status, and the error index.
4. The output will be in the following format (the values below are the correct information for the SNMP message bytes above):
Field Value
--------------- -----------
Size of Message 62 Bytes
Version 2
Community public
PDU Type Get Request
Request ID 949517775
Error Status 0
Error Index 0
