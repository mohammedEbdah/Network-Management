acquire a hands-on experience with the YANG data modeling language to write a YANG model.
the Webserver’s access log records using YANG modeling.
The model requirements are as follows:
• The module name is xxxxxx, where ‘xxxxxx’ is filename.
• Each record in the access log file consists of the following fields:
– The IP address of the client,
– The timestamp of the request (represented in Epoch Unix time),
– The HTTP method,
– The resource/file requested,
– The HTTP version,
– The status code of the response,
– The number of bytes transferred to the client, and
– The client’s user agent.
The following lines give an example of the contents of the access log file
